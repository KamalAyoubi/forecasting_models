# Visualization of the intensity curve of bikes from 10 eco-meters placed in Montpellier 

 -  Our objective for this part is to visualize the intensity of the bicycles passing a contage point in 10 deferens position in Montpellier.

 -  In our dataset, the bicycles are counted every day. we will consider the date of the end of days (which would be the start of the next day)

-   For each count point, we will plot the intensity variation curve as a function of time (days)

 -   To achieve our goal, we start with several transformations and manipulations on the raw databases, and finish by programming a widgets in which we can choose the desired position (between the 10 count points).
